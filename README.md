A Swift Core Data wrapper. PoliteCoreData uses Swift models instead Core Data managed objects because their usage is not safe. Also PoliteCoreData supports incremental migration that solves problem migrating between not neighboring versions (e.g version 1 to version 5).

## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate PoliteCoreData into your Xcode project with CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Shakuro.PoliteCoreData'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use CocoaPods, you can integrate Shakuro.PoliteCoreData simply by copying it to your project.
